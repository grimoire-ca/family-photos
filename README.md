# Long-Term Storage for Family Photos

My mother scanned multiple decades of family photos to high-resolution TIFFs. This reposiotry creates and manages a bucket to hold backup copies of those photos. _This is not the only backup_, but it is an important backup.

The bucket created by this repository is non-public.
